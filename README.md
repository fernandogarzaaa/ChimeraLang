# ChimeraLang

**A programming language designed for AI cognition** — probabilistic types, quantum consensus gates, directed hallucination, cryptographic integrity proofs, and a Cognitive Intermediate Representation (CIR) with self-evolving symbol emergence.

ChimeraLang treats uncertainty, confidence, and epistemic state as **first-class language primitives** rather than bolted-on libraries. Programs in ChimeraLang describe *how an AI should think*, not just what it should compute.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **CIR — Cognitive Intermediate Representation** | A graph-based IR where beliefs flow as Beta distributions through Inquiry → Consensus → Validation → Evolution nodes |
| **Belief System** | `belief`/`inquire`/`resolve`/`guard`/`evolve` — first-class epistemic constructs backed by Dempster-Shafer evidence combination |
| **Probabilistic Types** | `Confident<T>`, `Explore<T>`, `Converge<T>`, `Provisional<T>` — types that carry confidence scores |
| **Quantum Consensus Gates** | Multiple candidate values vote under Gaussian noise; the result is the *consensus* of an ensemble |
| **Symbol Emergence** | Reusable CIR subgraphs discovered automatically via Weisfeiler-Lehman hashing + TF-IDF similarity, evolved by Darwinian fitness competition |
| **Hallucination Detection** | Inline `detect` blocks + guard nodes with variance-aware Beta distribution checks |
| **Cryptographic Integrity** | Merkle-chain proofs and gate certificates ensure reasoning traces are tamper-evident |
| **Temporal Belief Decay** | Beliefs with TTL decay toward uniform prior as they age — staleness is uncertainty, not error |
| **Memory Modifiers** | `Ephemeral`, `Persistent`, `Provisional` — explicit lifecycle for every binding |
| **Interactive REPL** | `chimera repl` — try the language live in your terminal |

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fernandogarzaaa/ChimeraLang
cd ChimeraLang
python -m chimera.cli run examples/belief_reasoning.chimera --trace
```

**Requirements:** Python ≥ 3.11, no external dependencies. Install `anthropic` for live LLM `inquire` calls; otherwise runs with a mock adapter.

---

## Two Execution Paths

ChimeraLang has two fully independent, backward-compatible execution paths:

| Path | Triggered by | Constructs |
|---|---|---|
| **CIR path** | Any `belief` declaration | `belief`, `inquire`, `resolve`, `guard`, `evolve`, `symbol` |
| **VM path** | All other programs | `fn`, `gate`, `goal`, `reason`, `val`, `for`, `match` |

Existing programs run identically. New CIR programs are automatically routed.

## The CIR Belief System

### Syntax

```chimera
belief cause := inquire {
  prompt: "What are the primary causes of black hole formation?",
  agents: [claude],
  ttl: 3600
}

resolve cause with consensus { threshold: 0.8, strategy: dempster_shafer }
guard cause against hallucination { max_risk: 0.2, strategy: both }
evolve cause until stable { max_iter: 3 }

emit cause
```

### Run it

```bash
python -m chimera.cli run examples/belief_reasoning.chimera --trace
```

```
  emit: cause  [mean=0.750 variance=0.0170]

— CIR Reasoning Trace —
  [inquiry] prompt='What are the primary causes...' agents=['claude']
  [inquiry] confidence=0.750 -> Beta(7.5,2.5)
  [consensus] strategy=dempster_shafer threshold=0.75
  [consensus] combined mean=0.750 variance=0.0170
  [guard] max_risk=0.25 strategy=both
  [guard] PASSED — mean=0.750 variance=0.0170
  [evolve] condition=stable max_iter=3

chimera: examples/belief_reasoning.chimera — CIR executed in 0.1ms
```

### Saving and reusing symbols

```bash
# First run: extract and save reusable subgraph symbols
python -m chimera.cli run program.chimera --save-symbols=symbols.json

# Later runs: load symbols to bootstrap belief patterns
python -m chimera.cli run program.chimera --load-symbols=symbols.json
```

### How beliefs work

Beliefs are **Beta distributions** `Beta(α, β)` — not scalar floats. This means:

- `mean = α / (α + β)` — the estimated truth value
- `variance = αβ / ((α+β)²(α+β+1))` — how uncertain we are about the estimate
- Low pseudocounts = high variance = little evidence = uncertain belief
- `inquire` converts a confidence score to `Beta(conf×10, (1-conf)×10)`

### Dempster-Shafer consensus (`resolve`)

`resolve` combines N beliefs using DS evidence combination — not a naive weighted average. When two sources conflict (one says very high, other says very low), a `ConflictException` is raised rather than silently averaging to 0.5.

### Guard (`guard`)

`guard` checks: `mean ≥ (1 − max_risk)` AND `variance ≤ 0.05`. A belief that's above the mean threshold but wildly uncertain still fails the variance check.

### Free Energy evolution (`evolve`)

`evolve` runs a fixed-point loop minimizing KL divergence between successive belief updates — inspired by Friston's Active Inference framework. Terminates when `KL < 0.001` or `max_iter` reached.

### Symbol Emergence

After each execution, ChimeraLang automatically extracts reusable CIR subgraphs:

1. **Weisfeiler-Lehman hashing** — structural identity across different prompts
2. **TF-IDF cosine similarity** — semantically similar subgraphs (score > 0.7) are merged
3. **Multi-objective fitness** — `0.35×compression + 0.25×depth + 0.20×coherence + 0.20×usage`
4. **Darwinian competition** — every 10 uses, bottom 20% by fitness are pruned; survivors mutate
5. **CRDT G-Set store** — conflict-free distributed symbol library (merge = union)

## VM Path (Existing Language)

### Quantum Consensus Gates

```chimera
gate consensus_answer(question: Text) -> Converge<Text>
  branches: 5
  collapse: weighted_vote
  threshold: 0.80
  val answer: Text = "Reasoned answer to: " + question
  return answer
end

val result = consensus_answer("What causes consciousness?")
```

### Probabilistic Types

```chimera
val answer: Confident<Int> = confident(42, 0.95)
val idea:   Explore<Text>  = explore("maybe this?", 0.60)
```

### For Loops + Match

```chimera
val scores = [0.92, 0.76, 0.88]
for s in scores
  emit s
end

match status
  | 1 => emit "running"
  | _ => emit "unknown"
end
```

### Hallucination Detection

```chimera
detect hallucination
  strategy: "range"
  on: temperature
  valid_range: [-50.0, 60.0]
  action: "flag"
end
```

## How It Differs

| Aspect | Traditional Languages | ChimeraLang |
|---|---|---|
| Values | Deterministic | Beta distributions carrying full uncertainty |
| Evidence combination | N/A | Dempster-Shafer (conflict-aware, not naive averaging) |
| Execution | Single-path | Ensemble consensus + CIR belief graph |
| Correctness | Tests/assertions | Continuous guard nodes + hallucination detection |
| Auditability | Logs | Cryptographic Merkle proofs + full reasoning trace |
| Learning | None | Symbol emergence — reusable patterns emerge from execution history |
| Staleness | N/A | Temporal decay — old beliefs become uncertain, not wrong |
